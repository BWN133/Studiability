# Studiability
**Studiability** is a virtual math teacher designed to process and solve math word problems efficiently and accurately. This system leverages advanced techniques to interpret and respond to complex mathematical queries, providing clear and concise answers.

## Acknowledgements
**Studiability** builds upon the foundations laid by two preceding projects:
1. **SELF-FILTER**: A large language model (LLM) enhancement tool specifically geared towards boosting performance on math word problems. For more details, visit [SELF-FILTER on GitHub]([https://github.com/BWN133/SELF-FILTER](https://github.com/BWN133/SEFL-FILTER)).
2. **Studiagent**: An LLM configured as a virtual math instructor that assists users by solving math problems and teaching mathematical concepts. For more details, visit [Studiagent on GitHub](https://github.com/BWN133/Studiagent).

Together, these projects contribute to the sophisticated capabilities of **Studiability**, aiming to make learning math more accessible and effective.
